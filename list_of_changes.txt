MAIN TEXT
=========

Lots of formatting changes, but content changes are limited to the following:

 - Page 2: "S+1" or "ZIP-seHSQC" -> corrected to "S+2" or "ZIP-seHSQC"

 - Fig 4c: 'Ernst angle' -> 'variable excitation'

 - Fig 4 caption, and text in Section 2.3: sin^(-1) -> arcsin (in accordance with IUPAC and ISO recommendations)

 - Reference list expanded to one-per-number, in line with Elsevier / JMR style

 - Reference 39 corrected (was previously the same as reference 27, which was incorrect)

 - Metadata in newly published references (43, 48, 66) updated

 - Experimental section modified to include links to Bruker User Library / Zenodo datasets
