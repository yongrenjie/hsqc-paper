        ``$\sim$cos'' represents the pathway for directly coupled proton magnetisation that is cosine-modulated after $t_1$: for the HMQC and HSQC, this is the only component that is detected.
        For the seHSQC, the sine-modulated component (labelled with ``$\sim$sin'') is also detected.
        ``bulk'' refers to the bulk magnetisation, i.e.\ protons that are not directly coupled to the heteronucleus.

By setting $\Delta' = 1/(4\cdot\onejch)$, theory predicts a larger sensitivity enhancement for \ce{CH} peaks, whereas \ce{CH2} and \ce{CH3} peaks should have the same sensitivity as in the unenhanced HSQC.
However, for the NOAH seHSQC, we note that the improvements in HSQC \ce{CH} sensitivity gained by moving from $\Delta' = 1/(8\cdot\onejch)$ (\figref{spor_spv2}b) to $\Delta' = 1/(4\cdot\onejch)$ (\figref{combined_1_4j}b) are marginal (ca.\ 10\%).
At the same time, for \ce{CH2} and \ce{CH3} peaks, we observe sensitivity \textit{losses} \hl{relative to the HSQC; this is likely due to pulse imperfections in the longer pulse sequence and is in line with previous studies} (ref.\ \citenum{Schleucher1994JBNMR} of the main text).

\section{Comparison of BIG-BIRD and ISR elements}

The BIG-BIRD element used here was ${45^\circ}_{45^\circ}(\proton{}) - 2\Delta - 180^\circ(\proton{},\carbon{}) - 2\Delta - {45^\circ}_{225^\circ}(\proton{})$ for the unedited NOAH seHSQC, where $\beta_\phi$ indicates a hard pulse with flip angle $\beta$ and phase $\phi$, and $\Delta = 1/(4\cdot\onejch)$.
For the edited NOAH seHSQC, the BIG-BIRD pulse phases are slightly modified to give ${45^\circ}_{315^\circ}(\proton{}) - 2\Delta - 180^\circ(\proton{},\carbon{}) - 2\Delta - {45^\circ}_{135^\circ}(\proton{})$.
These, and the ISR, have the same net effect on \magn{\ce{C}} and \magnnot{\ce{C}} magnetisation, as can be seen from the product operator analysis in \figref{pprogs_prodop}.
However, the ISR provides greater sensitivity in both the HSQC and downstream COSY.

\section{Origin and suppression of wing artefacts}

The origin of the ``wing'' artefacts in the final homonuclear modules can be most clearly seen from the following series of experiments involving the NOAH-3 \nitrogen{} seHSQC/\carbon{} seHSQC/CLIP-COSY (\noahthree{Spn}{Sp}{Cc}) supersequence.
Since the $f_1$ spectral windows of the two seHSQC modules are different, they lead to distinct sets of wing artefacts in the COSY if the extra gradient before $t_1$ is not present.
As described in the main text, each peak in the COSY with an indirect-dimension frequency of $f_1 = \Omega_{\ce{H}}$ is flanked by a pair of artefacts at
\begin{align*}
    f_1 &= \Omega_{\ce{H}} \pm \Omega_{\ce{H}} \cdot \left(\frac{\mathrm{SW_{COSY}}}{2 \cdot \mathrm{SW_{HSQC}}}\right),
\end{align*}

where $\Omega_{\ce{H}}$ is the offset of the relevant proton and $\mathrm{SW}$ refers to the indirect-dimension spectral width.
In the spectra shown in the following figures, we have
\begin{align*}
    \mathrm{SW_{\ce{^15N}\,HSQC}} &= \SI{2128}{\Hz} \\
    \mathrm{SW_{\ce{^13C}\,HSQC}} &= \SI{23810}{\Hz} \\
    \mathrm{SW_{COSY}}            &= \SI{8418}{\Hz}
\end{align*}

meaning that the artefacts coming from the \nitrogen{} seHSQC occur at $f_1 = (1.00 \pm 1.98) \Omega_{\ce{H}}$ (and are therefore often folded), whereas artefacts coming from the \carbon{} seHSQC occur at $f_1 = (1.00 \pm 0.18) \Omega_{\ce{H}}$ (and are typically found very close to the main peak).
In both cases, the artefacts associated with intense methyl group peaks are the most obvious, but similar artefacts are observed for all other peaks, albeit with lower absolute intensities.

\end{figure}


\section{\texorpdfstring{\nitrogen{}}{15N} HSQC and line broadening}

For \nitrogen{}--\proton{} correlations, both the HMQC and the new seHSQC module are recommended as they keep the bulk magnetisation (both \magn{\ce{C}} and \magnnot{\ce{X}}) along $\pm z$ during the $t_1$ period.
The HSQC module places this magnetisation in the $xy$-plane during $t_1$, leading to $\jhh$ evolution; consequently, the amount of bulk magnetisation ``passed on'' to the downstream modules decreases as the \nitrogen{} $t_1$ is increased.
Since $t_1$ for each NOAH module is incremented in sync, this is manifested in downstream modules as a $t_1$-dependent decrease in amplitude, or $f_1$ line broadening after Fourier transformation, as shown in \figref{n15_linebroadening}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    % figures/n15_linebroadening.py
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./figures/n15_linebroadening.png}
    \caption{
        \carbon{} seHSQC spectra obtained from NOAH-3 \noahthree{X}{Sp}{Cc} (\nitrogen{} module + \carbon{} seHSQC + CLIP-COSY) supersequences.
        The \nitrogen{} spectral window was \SI{30}{ppm} and 256 $t_1$ increments were collected, corresponding to an indirect-dimension \nitrogen{} acquisition time of \SI{60.1}{\ms}.
        \textbf{(a)} X = HMQC.
        \textbf{(b)} X = HSQC.
        \textbf{(c)} X = seHSQC.

        \grami{}
    }
    \label{fig:n15_linebroadening}
\end{figure}

This line broadening also leads to a substantial sensitivity loss (for example, across all peaks, the \carbon{} seHSQC in \figref{n15_linebroadening}b has almost 65\% lower sensitivity than that in \figref{n15_linebroadening}a).
The extent of the line broadening depends on the acquisition time, and is particularly pronounced for long acquisition times, i.e.\ small \nitrogen{} spectral windows.
In our experience, at \nitrogen{} acquisition times of ca.\ \SI{5}{\ms} the effect is almost indiscernible.
Such a short acquisition time would lead to poor resolution in the \nitrogen{} dimension itself, which may or may not be tolerable.
Of course, this issue can be entirely avoided by using either the HMQC or seHSQC.

\section{Effect of lengthened gradients in \texorpdfstring{\nitrogen{}}{15N} modules}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.9]{./figures/zolmi.png}\phantom{aaaaaa}

        The peaks at 7.8 and \SI{10.7}{\ppm} (\proton{} shifts) are genuine crosspeaks; the mixed-phase peaks at \SI{2.2}{\ppm} are artefacts.
        The 1D \proton{} spectrum is shown above each of the 2D spectra in \textbf{(a)}--\textbf{(c)}; the artefacts seen in the 2D correspond to the intense \textit{N}-methyl groups at \SI{2.2}{\ppm}.

        The numbers indicate relative peak heights (normalised against the \SI{10.7}{\ppm} peak in (d)).
        \zolmi{}
    }
    \label{fig:cnst16_diff}
\end{figure}

The lengthening of CTP gradients from \SI{1}{\ms} to \SI{2.5}{\ms} is aimed at cleaning up artefacts arising from bulk magnetisation that is not properly returned to $+z$ at the end of the sequence.
\figref{cnst16_diff} shows exactly how effective this strategy is.
In (d), where the CTP gradients have their original duration, the artefacts originating from the intense methyl groups have comparable intensity to the desired peaks.
When the gradients are lengthened in (e), the crosspeak intensities are almost unaffected, whereas the artefacts are suppressed by a factor of 5 or more.
Although this suppression is not complete, this should not be interpreted as a weakness of the new NOAH seHSQC module, as similar artefacts are also visible in the CRK seHSQC (f).
Indeed, every \nitrogen{}--\proton{} experiment we tested has at least \textit{some} artefact intensity in this region.

\section{Effect of \texorpdfstring{$k$}{k}-scaling}

The effect of $k$-scaling on the HMQC is shown in \figref{hmqc_kscale}.
By decreasing the indirect dimension resolution, the $f_1$ linewidths of the peaks increase: this can lead to significant sensitivity enhancement for the HMQC (up to $2.7 \times$), because $\jhh$ splitting in the $f_1$ dimension is no longer resolved.
The largest gains are observed for peaks where $\jhh$ splitting is more visible; for the leftmost peak at $\delta_{\ce{N}} = \SI{128}{\ppm}$ which has no resolved $\jhh$ splitting, only a more modest $1.7 \times$ gain in sensitivity is attained.

For the seHSQC module, $k$-scaling on its own leads to far smaller sensitivity gains (\figref{spv2_kscale}).
Any increase in the total peak volume is almost completely offset by the $f_1$ broadening.
Therefore, even at $k = 8$, the largest sensitivity gains that can be attained are $\sim 1.3\times$.

The use of linear prediction for spectra with $k > 1$ can, to a certain extent, compensate for the line broadening.
This is less successful for the HMQC spectra (\figref{hmqc_kscale_lp}).
Although raw gains in peak height can be observed for all values of $k$, there is a corresponding decrease in the spectral quality, as evidenced by the $f_1$ multiplet structure being increasingly distorted.
On the other hand, linear prediction performs well for the seHSQC spectra (\figref{spv2_kscale_lp}), where there is no multiplet structure in $f_1$.
Even the reconstruction with $k = 8$ has reasonable spectral quality: although the 2D spectrum (d) appears to have unusual peak shapes, this is merely the result of having the same contour levels as the $k = 1$ spectrum.
The actual peaks are still clearly singlets, as can be seen from the projection in (h).

An additional example of successful $k$-scaling and linear prediction (with $k = 4$) can be seen in Section \ref{section:si_spectra}.

\section{HSQC-TOCSY/HSQC sensitivity comparisons}

The signal intensities for the NOAH-3 \noahthree{St}{S}{Cc} (HSQC-TOCSY + HSQC + CLIP-COSY) supersequences can be more conveniently measured by omitting the DIPSI-2 isotropic mixing in the HSQC-TOCSY supersequence, leading to a NOAH-3 \noahthree{S}{S}{Cc} (HSQC + HSQC + CLIP-COSY) supersequence.
This allows us to compare the different versions of double-HSQC sequences, as the two HSQC modules can be implemented either using the MFA approach, or the new ASAP/NOAH approach based on Ernst angle excitation in the first module.
In the latter implementation, the parameter $f$ can be varied between 0.4 and 1; it represents the proportion of \magn{\ce{C}} magnetisation used in the first HSQC, as described in the main text.
Furthermore, to boost the sensitivity of the second HSQC module in the NOAH supersequences, the new seHSQC module can be used in its place.

\figref{ssc_comparisons} may be understood in the following way:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The MFA HSQC sensitivities (in (a)) are approximately half that of a standard CRK seHSQC, with the second HSQC having slightly lower sensitivity.
        This is discussed in ref.\ \citenum{Nolis2019CPC} of the main text.
    \item The sensitivity of the first NOAH HSQC (blue in (b) and (c)) is generally equal to $f$, supporting the interpretation of $f$ as the fraction of \carbon{}--\proton{} magnetisation excited in the first HSQC.
    \item The sensitivity of the second NOAH HSQC (orange in (b)) arises from whatever is \textit{not} used by the first HSQC, plus any magnetisation that relaxes during the FID of the first HSQC.
        As $f$ is decreased, the former contribution increases and the latter tapers off.
        This is true for the seHSQC as well (orange in (c)), except that there is a uniform boost in sensitivity for all values of $f$.
        This sensitivity improvement mainly applies to \ce{CH} groups, as discussed in the main text.
    \item The MFA COSY sensitivity (green) is substantially lower ($\sim 15\%$) because the bulk magnetisation is dephased by the previous modules, whereas in the NOAH approach it is (largely) preserved.
\end{itemize}

It remains to evaluate the impact of adding DIPSI-2 mixing in one of the HSQC modules on the remaining modules in the supersequence.
This depends on whether the HSQC-TOCSY module is placed first (\noahthree{St}{S}{Cc} or \noahthree{St}{Sp}{Cc}) or second (\noahthree{S}{St}{Cc}) in the sequence.
Since the seHSQC module does not preserve unused \magn{\ce{C}} magnetisation, the HSQC-TOCSY in a hypothetical \noahthree{Sp}{St}{Cc} supersequence will have greatly reduced sensitivity.
On the other hand, placing the HSQC-TOCSY sequence first allows the seHSQC module to be used subsequent to this; we therefore consider only the permutations where the HSQC-TOCSY goes first.

    \label{fig:stsc_comparisons}
\end{figure}

It can be seen from \figref{stsc_comparisons} that the introduction of DIPSI-2 mixing leads to a very small drop ($< 10\%$) in the amount of \magnnot{\ce{C}} magnetisation preserved for the COSY module.
On the other hand, the HSQC (and seHSQC) sensitivites follow largely the same trend as before.
For values of $f$ above $0.7$ (where relatively little \magn{\ce{C}} magnetisation is preserved for these modules), the DIPSI-2 mixing helps to replenish some of this magnetisation.
As $f$ decreases, this effect becomes smaller, and at small $f$ it even leads to a reduction in signal intensity.
\hl{
As discussed in the main text, since the HSQC-TOCSY has a lower intrinsic sensitivity than the (se)HSQC, we recommend using a large value of $f$, such as $0.9$.
This does not compromise the HSQC-TOCSY intensity by much, and at the same time yields either a HSQC with $\sim 65\%$ of its original sensitivity, or a seHSQC which has $\sim 80\%$ of the sensitivity of a standard NOAH HSQC.
}

\hl{
Finally, we note that because a significant proportion of the HSQC signal derives from \magn{\ce{C}} relaxation during the HSQC-TOCSY FID, use of a larger acquisition time (AQ) can potentially boost the HSQC sensitivity even further.
The experiments shown above were carried out with a relatively short AQ of \SI{73}{\ms}.
\textbf{However, bear in mind that the high duty cycle associated with broadband \ce{^13C} decoupling can potentially cause hardware damage if applied for too long, especially given that the supersequences described here have two consecutive \ce{^13C}-decoupled modules.}
