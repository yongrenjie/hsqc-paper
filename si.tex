\section{Effect of setting \texorpdfstring{$\Delta' = 1/(4\cdot\onejch)$}{Delta' = 1/(4*1JCH)} in seHSQC}

The $\Delta'$ delay in the CRK and NOAH seHSQC sequences can be set to $1/(4\cdot\onejch)$ in order to optimise the sensitivity enhancement for \ce{CH} groups only.
The effects of doing so are shown here for the unedited and edited seHSQCs respectively.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    % figures/combined_1_4j.py
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./figures/combined_1_4j.png}
    \caption{
        Sensitivity of seHSQC sequences with $\Delta'$ set to $1/(4\cdot\onejch)$, versus the corresponding NOAH HSQC/CLIP-COSY supersequence (i.e.\ unedited for (a) and (b), edited for (c) and (d)).
        \andro{}
        \textbf{(a)} CRK seHSQC + CLIP-COSY, without multiplicity editing.
        \textbf{(b)} NOAH seHSQC + CLIP-COSY, without multiplicity editing.

        \textbf{(d)} NOAH seHSQC + CLIP-COSY, with multiplicity editing.
    }
    \label{fig:combined_1_4j}
\end{figure}

In particular, for the NOAH seHSQC, we note that the improvements in HSQC \ce{CH} sensitivity gained by moving from $\Delta' = 1/(8\cdot\onejch)$ to $\Delta' = 1/(4\cdot\onejch)$ are marginal (ca.\ 10\%).
At the same time, sensitivity \textit{losses} are observed for \ce{CH2} and \ce{CH3} peaks, likely due to pulse imperfections.

\section{Comparison of BIG-BIRD and ISR elements}

The BIG-BIRD element used here was ${45^\circ}_{45^\circ}(\proton{}) - 2\Delta - 180^\circ(\proton{},\carbon{}) - 2\Delta - {45^\circ}_{225^\circ}(\proton{})$ for the unedited NOAH seHSQC, where $\beta_\phi$ indicates a hard pulse with flip angle $\beta$ and phase $\phi$, and $\Delta = 1/(4\cdot\onejch)$.
For the edited NOAH seHSQC, the BIG-BIRD pulse phases are slightly modified to give ${45^\circ}_{315^\circ}(\proton{}) - 2\Delta - 180^\circ(\proton{},\carbon{}) - 2\Delta - {45^\circ}_{135^\circ}(\proton{})$.
These, and the ISR, have the same net effect on coupled and uncoupled proton magnetisation.
However, the ISR provides greater sensitivity in both the HSQC and downstream COSY.

\section{Suppression of wing artefacts}

The origin of the ``wing'' artefacts in the final homonuclear modules can be most clearly seen from the following series of experiments involving the NOAH-3 \nitrogen{} seHSQC/\carbon{} seHSQC/CLIP-COSY (SpSpCc) supersequence.
Since the $f_1$ spectral windows of the two seHSQC modules are different, they lead to distinct sets of wing artefacts if the extra gradient before $t_1$ is not present.
\figref{wing_artefacts} focuses on the artefacts associated with intense methyl group peaks, but similar artefacts are observed for all other peaks, albeit with lower absolute intensities.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    % figures/wing_artefacts.py
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./figures/wing_artefacts.png}
    \caption{
        CLIP-COSY spectra obtained from various forms of the NOAH-3 SpSpCc supersequence.
        Wing artefacts arising from the \nitrogen{} seHSQC are highlighted in orange; those arising from the \carbon{} seHSQC in green.
        Notice how (in this case) the former can easily be misinterpreted as a crosspeak, while the latter obscures genuine crosspeaks.

        \textbf{(b)} With an extra gradient in only the \nitrogen{} module, i.e.\ only the \carbon{} artefacts.
        \textbf{(c)} With an extra gradient in only the \carbon{} module.
        \textbf{(d)} With no extra gradients.
    }

\section{\texorpdfstring{\nitrogen{}}{15N} HSQC and line broadening}

For \nitrogen{}--\proton{} correlations, both the HMQC and the new seHSQC module are recommended as they keep the bulk magnetisation along $\pm z$ during the $t_1$ period.
The HSQC module places bulk magnetisation in the $xy$-plane, leading to $\jhh$ evolution; consequently, the amount of bulk magnetisation ``passed on'' to the downstream modules decreases as the \nitrogen{} $t_1$ is increased.
Since $t_1$ for each NOAH module is incremented in sync, this is manifested in downstream modules as a $t_1$-dependent decrease in amplitude, or $f_1$ line broadening after Fourier transformation, as shown in \figref{n15_linebroadening}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    % figures/n15_linebroadening.py
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./figures/n15_linebroadening.png}
    \caption{
        \carbon{} seHSQC spectra obtained from NOAH-3 XSpCc (\nitrogen{} module + \carbon{} seHSQC + CLIP-COSY) supersequences.
        \grami{}
        The \nitrogen{} spectral window was \SI{30}{ppm} and 256 $t_1$ increments were collected, corresponding to an indirect-dimension \nitrogen{} acquisition time of \SI{60.1}{\ms}.
        \textbf{(a)} X = HMQC.
        \textbf{(b)} X = HSQC.
        \textbf{(c)} X = seHSQC.
        \textbf{(d)}--\textbf{(f)} Projections of spectra \textbf{(a)}--\textbf{(c)} onto the $f_1$ axis.
        Note the $f_1$ line broadening in (b) and (e).
    }
    \label{fig:n15_linebroadening}
\end{figure}

This line broadening also leads to a substantial sensitivity loss (almost 65\% in \figref{n15_linebroadening}).
The extent of the line broadening depends on the acquisition time, and is particularly pronounced for long acquisition times, i.e.\ small \nitrogen{} spectral windows.
In our experience, at \nitrogen{} acquisition times of ca.\ \SI{5}{\ms} the effect is almost indiscernible.
Such a short acquisition time would lead to poor resolution in the \nitrogen{} dimension itself, which may or may not be tolerable.
Of course, this issue can be entirely avoided by using either the HMQC or seHSQC.
