\section{Origin and suppression of wing artefacts}

The origin of the ``wing'' artefacts in the final homonuclear modules can be most clearly seen from the following series of experiments involving the NOAH-3 \nitrogen{} seHSQC/\carbon{} ZIP-seHSQC/CLIP-COSY (\noahthree{Spn}{Spb}{Cc}) supersequence.
As described in the main text, if the extra gradient before $t_1$ is not present, each peak in the COSY with an indirect-dimension frequency of $f_1 = \Omega_{\ce{H}}$ is flanked by a pair of artefacts at
\begin{align*}
    f_1 &= \Omega_{\ce{H}} \pm \Omega_{\ce{H}} \cdot \left(\frac{\mathrm{SW_{COSY}}}{2 \cdot \mathrm{SW_{HSQC}}}\right),
\end{align*}

where $\Omega_{\ce{H}}$ is the offset of the relevant proton and $\mathrm{SW}$ refers to the indirect-dimension spectral width.
Since the $f_1$ spectral widths of the two seHSQC modules are different, they lead to distinct sets of wing artefacts in the COSY.
In the spectra shown in the following figures, we have
\begin{align*}
    \mathrm{SW_{\ce{^15N}\,HSQC}} &= \SI{2128}{\Hz} \\
    \mathrm{SW_{\ce{^13C}\,HSQC}} &= \SI{23810}{\Hz} \\
    \mathrm{SW_{COSY}}            &= \SI{8418}{\Hz}
\end{align*}

meaning that the artefacts coming from the \nitrogen{} seHSQC occur at $f_1 = (1.00 \pm 1.98) \Omega_{\ce{H}}$ (and are therefore often folded), whereas artefacts coming from the \carbon{} seHSQC occur at $f_1 = (1.00 \pm 0.18) \Omega_{\ce{H}}$ (and are typically found very close to the main peak).
In both cases, the artefacts associated with intense methyl group peaks are the most obvious, but similar artefacts are observed for all other peaks, albeit with lower absolute intensities.

Additional information can be gleaned from the following series of CLIP-COSY spectra, obtained from NOAH-2 \noahtwo{Spb}{Cc} supersequences.
In the seHSQC module, the two gradients $g_1$ in the $t_1$ period are independently enabled or disabled (by setting their amplitude to 0).
Traces of the resulting CLIP-COSY spectra are shown in \cref{fig:wing_gradients}.
The gradients serve to dephase any bulk \magnnot{\ce{C}} magnetisation that is transverse during either half of $t_1$: therefore, if (for example) the gradient in the first half of $t_1$ is switched off, this allows bulk magnetisation that is transverse in the first half of $t_1$ to evolve and ultimately contribute to the wing artefacts in the CLIP-COSY.
As can be seen, gradients must be applied in \textit{both} halves for complete suppression of the wing artefacts.

        \textbf{(b)} $f_1$ traces through \SI{0.67}{\ppm} of the four CLIP-COSY spectra obtained with various combinations of gradients, corresponding to the boxed area in (a).
        Only the (on, on) spectrum (in blue) is free from wing artefacts.
        The (on, off) and (off, on) spectra (in orange and green respectively) have wing artefacts arising from bulk magnetisation that evolves during the second and first halves of the seHSQC $t_1$ period respectively.
        The (off, off) spectrum (red), which corresponds to the 2D spectrum in (a), has the greatest intensity of wing artefacts.

It is interesting to note that the evolution of magnetisation during multiple indirect dimensions is the basis of projection spectroscopy,\autocite{projrecon} where the resulting sums and differences of frequencies can be used to reconstruct higher-dimensional spectra.
In the present context, the aim is instead to suppress these peaks, permitting evolution to only occur in a single indirect dimension.

\end{figure}

By setting $\Delta' = 1/(4\cdot\onejch)$, theory predicts a larger sensitivity enhancement for \ce{CH} peaks, whereas \ce{CH2} and \ce{CH3} peaks should have sensitivities comparable to the unenhanced HSQC.

Although the CRK seHSQC has slightly better performance over the NOAH seHSQCs, its major drawback remains in that it does not preserve any \magnnot{\ce{X}} magnetisation for a subsequent homonuclear module (\cref{fig:1_4j_unedited_crk}): the duration of $\Delta'$ chosen does not affect this in any way.
Thus, we limit our discussion to the two NOAH seHSQC variants (\cref{fig:1_4j_unedited_spv1,fig:1_4j_unedited_spv2}).
Both of these do indeed display the expected gains for \ce{CH} peaks: the corresponding sensitivities with $\Delta' = 1/(8\cdot\onejch)$ are shown in \cref{fig:sehsqc_comp}.
For \ce{CH2} and \ce{CH3} peaks, we observe sensitivity \textit{losses} even relative to the unenhanced HSQC; this is likely due to pulse imperfections in the longer pulse sequence and is in line with previous studies.\autocite{Schleucher1994JBNMR}
This is generally not desirable in a \carbon{} seHSQC, where \ce{CH2} peaks are common and are often further split due to diastereotopicity.
However, in the \nitrogen{} seHSQC, the delay $\Delta'$ can often be set to $1/(4\cdot\onejnh)$ to provide the maximum sensitivity enhancement for \ce{NH} peaks.

The inclusion of multiplicity editing in the sequences with $\Delta' = 1/(4\cdot\onejch)$ makes no substantial difference to the results (\cref{fig:1_4j_edited}), save for a slight relative improvement in the amount of \magnnot{\ce{X}} magnetisation preserved by the \noahSpb{} module.
The reasons for this are discussed in the main text.

\section{Comparison of BIG-BIRD and ZIP elements}

The BIG-BIRD element used here was ${45^\circ}_{45^\circ}(\proton{}) - 2\Delta - 180^\circ(\proton{},\carbon{}) - 2\Delta - {45^\circ}_{225^\circ}(\proton{})$ for the unedited NOAH seHSQC, where $\beta_\phi$ indicates a hard pulse with flip angle $\beta$ and phase $\phi$, and $\Delta = 1/(4\cdot\onejch)$.
For the edited NOAH seHSQC, the BIG-BIRD pulse phases are slightly modified to give ${45^\circ}_{315^\circ}(\proton{}) - 2\Delta - 180^\circ(\proton{},\carbon{}) - 2\Delta - {45^\circ}_{135^\circ}(\proton{})$.
These, and the ZIP, have the same net effect on \magn{\ce{C}} and \magnnot{\ce{C}} magnetisation, as can be seen from the product operator analysis in \cref{fig:pprogs_prodop}.
Thus, they can be used interchangeably in version 2 of the NOAH seHSQC.
However, the ZIP provides greater sensitivity in both the HSQC and downstream COSY (\cref{fig:bigbird}).

On average, both versions of the NOAH seHSQC provide sensitivity gains for HSQC \ce{CH} and \ce{CH2} peaks (\cref{fig:edited_sn_comp_spv1,fig:edited_sn_comp_spv2}) while not compromising the COSY intensities as the CRK seHSQC does (\cref{fig:edited_sn_comp_crk}).
The \noahSpb{} module in particular provides slightly better performance.
Note also how the COSY intensities with the \noahSpb{} module are on average higher than with the original HSQC module: this indicates that the \noahSpb{} module preserves bulk \magnnot{\ce{C}} magnetisation better.
As discussed in the main text, this is because the bulk magnetisation is longitudinal during the editing period.

\section{\texorpdfstring{\nitrogen{}}{15N} HSQC and line broadening}

For \proton{}--\nitrogen{} correlations, both the HMQC and version 2 of the new seHSQC are recommended as they keep the bulk magnetisation (both \magn{\ce{C}} and \magnnot{\ce{X}}) along $\pm z$ during the $t_1$ period.
The HSQC module, as well as version 1 of the seHSQC, place this magnetisation in the $xy$-plane during $t_1$, leading to $\jhh$ evolution; consequently, the amount of bulk magnetisation ``passed on'' to the downstream modules decreases as the \nitrogen{} $t_1$ is increased.
Since $t_1$ for each NOAH module is incremented in sync, this is manifested in downstream modules as a $t_1$-dependent decrease in amplitude, or $f_1$ line broadening after Fourier transformation, as shown in \cref{fig:n15_linebroadening}.

\begin{figure}

    }
    \label{fig:n15_linebroadening}
\end{figure}

This line broadening also leads to a substantial sensitivity loss (for example, across all peaks, the \carbon{} seHSQC in \cref{fig:n15_linebroadening_hsqc} has almost 65\% lower sensitivity than that in \cref{fig:n15_linebroadening_hmqc}).
The extent of the line broadening depends on the acquisition time (AQ), and is particularly pronounced for long acquisition times, i.e.\ small \nitrogen{} spectral widths.
Thus, the effect may be mitigated by reducing AQ, for example by using $k$-scaling: indeed, the \SI{60.1}{\ms} used in \cref{fig:n15_linebroadening} to illustrate the effect is often not necessary for \nitrogen{} spectra.
However, even at an AQ of \SI{15.0}{\ms} (i.e.\ $k = 4$), there is still discernible broadening which leads to a 25\% loss of sensitivity.
Of course, this issue can be entirely avoided by using either the HMQC or seHSQC.

        The 1D \proton{} spectrum is shown above each of the 2D spectra in \textbf{(a)}--\textbf{(c)}; the artefacts seen in the 2D correspond to the intense \textit{N}-methyl groups at \SI{2.2}{\ppm}.

    }
    \label{fig:cnst16_diff}
\end{figure}

The lengthening of CTP gradients from \SI{1}{\ms} to \SI{2.5}{\ms} is aimed at cleaning up artefacts arising from bulk magnetisation that is not properly returned to $+z$ at the end of the sequence.
\cref{fig:cnst16_diff} shows exactly how effective this strategy is.
In (d), where the CTP gradients have their original duration, the artefacts originating from the intense methyl groups have comparable intensity to the desired peaks.
When the gradients are lengthened in (e), the crosspeak intensities are almost unaffected, whereas the artefacts are suppressed by a factor of 5 or more.
Although this suppression is not complete, this should not be interpreted as a weakness of the new NOAH seHSQC module, as similar artefacts are also visible in the CRK seHSQC (f).
Indeed, every \proton{}--\nitrogen{} experiment we tested has at least \textit{some} artefact intensity in this region.

\section{Sensitivity and resolution in \texorpdfstring{\nitrogen{}}{15N} modules}

\subsection{Overview}

In ideal cases, it is possible to modify the acquisition scheme of a 2D experiment, such that resolution in the indirect dimension is decreased in return for gains in sensitivity: this has previously been illustrated in the context of time-shared \nitrogen{},\carbon{} HMBC spectra.\autocite{Perez-Trujillo2007MRC,Parella2010CMR}
This can prove to be useful particularly in \nitrogen{} modules, where the number of peaks is typically small, and are well-dispersed across the chemical shift range (thus minimising the chances of accidental overlap).
The key parameter here is the indirect-dimension acquisition time (AQ): a shorter AQ leads to poorer resolution but higher sensitivity (ideally).
We propose two different, but ultimately very similar, methods of reducing AQ:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $k$-scaling: decreasing the number of $t_1$ increments (TD1) by a factor of $k$ leads to a decrease in AQ by a factor of $k$. In its place, the number of scans (NS) can be increased by a factor of $k$.
    \item SW-scaling: increasing the indirect-dimension spectral width (SW) by a factor of $k$ (but leaving TD1 and NS unchanged) leads to an equivalent decrease in AQ.
\end{enumerate}

These possibilities are illustrated schematically in \cref{fig:kscale_overview}.
The ``standard'' experiment (\cref{fig:kscale_overview_std}) is acquired as described in the \textit{Experimental} section of the main text, i.e.\ TD1 = 256, NS = 2, and SW = 30 ppm (for gramicidin).

\subsection{Standard processing as performed in this work}

For both the $k$- and SW-scaled spectra, the entries that are \textit{not} marked ``(+LP)'' are processed as described in the \textit{Experimental} section of the main text.
In particular, linear prediction is used to construct another TD1 points beyond the TD1 originally acquired points, which corresponds to setting the processing parameters ME\_mod = `LPfc' (or `LPfr') and LPbin = 0.
This leads to an \textit{effective acquisition time}, $\aqeff$, which is double the original acquisition time AQ: in practice, the indirect-dimension resolution is not determined by AQ but rather $\aqeff$.

The results of $k$- and SW-scaling are illustrated in \cref{fig:hmqc_kscale,fig:spv2_kscale} for \nitrogen{} HMQC and seHSQC spectra respectively.
By decreasing the indirect dimension resolution, the $f_1$ linewidths of the peaks increase: this can lead to significant sensitivity enhancement for the HMQC (up to $2.6 \times$), because $\jhh$ splitting in the $f_1$ dimension is no longer resolved.
The largest gains are observed for peaks where $\jhh$ splitting is better resolved; for the leftmost peak at $\delta_{\ce{N}} = \SI{128}{\ppm}$ which has no resolved $\jhh$ splitting, only a more modest $1.7 \times$ gain in sensitivity is attained.
For the seHSQC module, $k$-scaling on its own leads to far smaller sensitivity gains (\cref{fig:spv2_kscale}).
Any increase in the total peak volume is almost completely offset by the $f_1$ broadening.
Therefore, even at $k = 8$, the largest sensitivity gains that can be attained are $\sim 1.3\times$.

\subsection{Extra linear prediction}

It is clear, however, that $\aqeff$ can be arbitrarily extended by applying more extensive linear prediction: this is the case for the experiments in \cref{fig:kscale_overview_std} marked with ``(+LP)''.
In each case, we have applied linear prediction up to the original $\aqeff$ of \SI{120.3}{\ms} in order to recover the resolution of the ``standard'' spectrum.
Although this leads to larger increases in peak height or SNR (by virtue of the decreased linewidths), this does not necessarily represent a true ``sensitivity gain'' in terms of the ability to reveal weak peaks.\autocite{snrsens}

Aggressive linear prediction is less successful for the HMQC spectra (\cref{fig:hmqc_kscale_lp}): although raw gains in peak height can be observed for all values of $k$, there is a corresponding decrease in the spectral quality, as evidenced by the $f_1$ multiplet structure becoming increasingly distorted.
On the other hand, linear prediction performs well for the seHSQC spectra (\cref{fig:spv2_kscale_lp}), where there is no multiplet structure in $f_1$.


\subsection{Discussion}

It is difficult to draw firm conclusions from the spectra shown here, but some general guidelines may be mentioned:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The sensitivity gains obtained without extra linear prediction (\cref{fig:hmqc_kscale,fig:spv2_kscale}) are almost identical for both $k$- and SW-scaling.
    \item $k$-scaling appears to provide larger raw gains in peak height when extra linear prediction is applied (\cref{fig:hmqc_kscale_lp,fig:spv2_kscale_lp}), although the fidelity of the reconstruction at large values of $k$ is questionable, particularly for the HMQC.
    \item $k$-scaling is currently not compatible with the use of non-uniform sampling (NUS) in the rest of the NOAH supersequence, because two distinct NUS schedules would have to be maintained in the pulse programme (one for the $k$-scaled module and one for the other modules).
        If NUS is desired, then SW-scaling is the only viable option.
\end{itemize}

It should also be noted that $k$-scaling is a special case of \textit{undersampling}, where the sampling schedule is chosen to simply be the first $\mathrm{TD1}/k$ points, and the remainder reconstructed via linear prediction.
A possible alternative would be to choose a different (non-uniform) sampling schedule for the \nitrogen{} module to reduce the number of $t_1$ increments, and in turn increase NS; the missing increments may be reconstructed using a number of NUS algorithms.
We briefly investigated this on the present sample, but did not see any noticeable differences as compared to $k$-scaling.
However, it is possible that under different circumstances, \textit{bona fide} sensitivity gains may be attained compared to the ``standard'' spectrum.\autocite{Mobli2014PNMRS,Palmer2015JPCB}

\section{HSQC-TOCSY/HSQC sensitivity comparisons}

The signal intensities for the NOAH-3 \noahthree{St}{S}{Cc} (HSQC-TOCSY + HSQC + CLIP-COSY) supersequences can be more conveniently measured by omitting the DIPSI-2 isotropic mixing in the HSQC-TOCSY supersequence, leading to a NOAH-3 \noahthree{S}{S}{Cc} (HSQC + HSQC + CLIP-COSY) supersequence.
This allows us to compare the different versions of double-HSQC sequences, as the two HSQC modules can be implemented either using the MFA approach, or the new ASAP/NOAH approach based on Ernst angle excitation in the first module.
In the latter implementation, the parameter $f$ can be varied between 0.4 and 1; it represents the proportion of \magn{\ce{C}} magnetisation used in the first HSQC, as described in the main text.
Furthermore, to boost the sensitivity of the second HSQC module in the NOAH supersequences, either of the two new seHSQC modules can be used in its place: we demonstrate this here with the ZIP-seHSQC (\noahSpb{}).

\begin{figure}
    \centering

    \caption{
        Sensitivities of HSQC and CLIP-COSY modules when used as part of a \noahthree{S}{S}{Cc}-type supersequence, with both the NOAH and MFA implementations of the two HSQC modules.

        \andro{}
    }
    \label{fig:ssc_comparisons}
\end{figure}

\cref{fig:ssc_comparisons} may be understood in the following way:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The MFA HSQC sensitivities (in (a)) are approximately half that of a standard CRK seHSQC, with the second HSQC having slightly lower sensitivity.\autocite{Nolis2019CPC}
    \item The sensitivity of the first NOAH HSQC (blue in (b) and (c)) is generally equal to $f$, supporting the interpretation of $f$ as the fraction of \magn{\ce{C}} magnetisation excited in the first HSQC.
    \item The sensitivity of the second NOAH HSQC (orange in (b)) arises from whatever is \textit{not} used by the first HSQC, plus any magnetisation that recovers during the FID of the first HSQC.
        As $f$ is decreased, the former contribution increases and the latter tapers off.
        This is true for the seHSQC as well (orange in (c)), except that there is a uniform boost in sensitivity for all values of $f$.
        This sensitivity improvement mainly applies to \ce{CH} groups, as discussed in the main text.
    \item The MFA COSY sensitivity (green) is substantially lower ($\sim 15\%$) because the bulk magnetisation is dephased by the previous modules, whereas in the NOAH approach it is (largely) preserved.
\end{itemize}

It remains to evaluate the impact of adding DIPSI-2 mixing in one of the HSQC modules on the remaining modules in the supersequence.
This depends on whether the HSQC-TOCSY module is placed first (\noahthree{St}{S}{Cc} or \noahthree{St}{Sp}{Cc}) or second (\noahthree{S}{St}{Cc}) in the sequence.
Since neither of the new seHSQC modules do preserve unused \magn{\ce{C}} magnetisation, the HSQC-TOCSY in a hypothetical \noahthree{Sp}{St}{Cc} supersequence will have greatly reduced sensitivity.
On the other hand, placing the HSQC-TOCSY sequence first allows the seHSQC module to be used subsequent to this; we therefore consider only the permutations where the HSQC-TOCSY goes first.

        The solid, darker lines indicate the supersequences beginning with the HSQC-TOCSY, whereas the dashed, lighter lines indicate the supersequences beginning with the HSQC (the latter are the same graphs as in \cref{fig:ssc_comparisons}).

        \textbf{(b)} With the seHSQC as the second module.
        \andro{}
    }
    \label{fig:stsc_comparisons}
\end{figure}

It can be seen from \cref{fig:stsc_comparisons} that the introduction of DIPSI-2 mixing leads to a very small drop ($< 10\%$) in the amount of \magnnot{\ce{C}} magnetisation preserved for the COSY module.
On the other hand, the HSQC (and seHSQC) sensitivites follow largely the same trend as before.
For values of $f$ above $0.7$ (where relatively little \magn{\ce{C}} magnetisation is preserved for these modules), the DIPSI-2 mixing helps to replenish some of this magnetisation.
As $f$ decreases, this effect becomes smaller, and at $f < 0.7$ it even leads to a \textit{reduction} in signal intensity (i.e.\ where the orange lines cross in \cref{fig:stsc_comparisons}).

As discussed in the main text, since the HSQC-TOCSY has a lower intrinsic sensitivity than the (se)HSQC, we recommend using a large value of $f$, such as $0.9$.
This does not compromise the HSQC-TOCSY intensity by much, and at the same time yields either a HSQC with $\sim 60\%$ of its original sensitivity, or a seHSQC which has $\sim 75\%$ of the sensitivity of a standalone NOAH HSQC module.
However, if the sensitivity of the HSQC-TOCSY component is to be maximised, then it is advisable to use the seHSQC-TOCSY module, which is based on the \noahSpb{} module.\autocite{Hansen2021}
This module cannot preserve any \magn{\ce{C}} magnetisation for the downstream HSQC, but does retain \magnnot{\ce{C}} magnetisation for homonuclear modules: its performance in this respect is therefore very similar to the HSQC-TOCSY with $f = 1$ (\cref{fig:sehsqc_tocsy}).
However, it provides greater sensitivity in the HSQC-TOCSY component itself, so is strictly better than the HSQC-TOCSY with $f = 1$.

    \centering
    % figures/sehsqc_tocsy.py

    }
    \label{fig:sehsqc_tocsy}
\end{figure}

Finally, we note that because a significant proportion of the HSQC signal derives from \magn{\ce{C}} relaxation during the HSQC-TOCSY FID, use of a longer AQ can potentially boost the HSQC sensitivity even further.
The experiments shown above were carried out with a relatively short AQ of \SI{73}{\ms}.
\textbf{However, bear in mind that the high duty cycle associated with broadband \ce{^13C} decoupling can potentially damage the probe if applied for too long, especially given that the supersequences described here have two consecutive \ce{^13C}-decoupled modules.}

\section{Sensitivity per unit time gains}

Whilst we have so far mainly focused on the \textit{time savings} that can be achieved via NOAH supersequences, it should also be noted that time savings can be translated into gains in sensitivity per unit time, according to the formula:\autocite{Kupce2019JMR}

$$\varepsilon_t = R_S \cdot \sqrt{\rho_t}$$

where $\varepsilon_t$ is the relative sensitivity per unit time, $\rho_t$ is the time saving factor (i.e.\ the total experimental time needed for conventional acquisition, divided by the duration of the NOAH supersequence), and $R_S$ is a factor indicating the relative sensitivity of the NOAH module compared to a reference experiment.
$R_S$ may in general be less than 1 due to several factors:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Imperfect retention of magnetisation by previous modules in a supersequence will reduce the value of $R_S$ for downstream modules.
        The resulting value of $R_S$ may range from $\sim 0.9$ (HSQC without sensitivity enhancement) to $\sim 0.1$ (CRK seHSQC), as shown in \cref{tbl:sehsqc_comp_cosy}.
    \item Any modifications made to the sequence in order to achieve other aims such as artefact suppression or preservation of unused magnetisation components may lead to loss of signal.
        This is the case with, for example, the NOAH seHSQC modules, which have lower sensitivity compared to the original CRK implementation (\cref{fig:sehsqc_comp,fig:cnst16_diff}).
\end{enumerate}

The value of $R_S$ for a given module therefore depends on each of the previous modules in a supersequence.
Since $R_S$ differs for each module in a supersequence, so does $\varepsilon_t$; if $\varepsilon_t > 1$ for a given module, then the supersequence can provide an increase in sensitivity per unit time for that module.

In \cref{fig:snr_modules} we demonstrated that $\varepsilon_t > 1$ for all four modules in the \noahfour{Spn}{Spb}{C}{T} supersequence.
The reference spectra there were taken to be the standalone NOAH modules, acquired as a set of four individual 2D experiments: thus, any reductions from $R_S$ must arise solely from item (1) above, as the sequences themselves are identical.

In \cref{fig:snr_bruker}, we perform the same comparison but this time using the ``gold standard'' 2D experiments (such as the CRK seHSQC) as the reference experiments: details of these experiments are provided in \cref{tbl:bruker_expts}.
This, together with the other SNR comparisons provided in this work, provide a measure of the losses in $R_S$ due to item (2) above.
Thus, the values of $\varepsilon_t$ are lower than in \cref{fig:snr_modules}.
However, we notably still have $\varepsilon_t > 1$ for the first three modules, and $\varepsilon_t \sim 1$ for the TOCSY, proving that NOAH supersequences do provide gains in sensitivity per unit time compared to conventional acquisition.
